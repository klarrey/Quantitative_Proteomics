##Analysis of shortgun proteomics data using DEP
DEP, an integrated pipeline provides a set of tools and functions to facilitate 
the analysis and derive insights from the rapidly accumulating mass spectrometry data,
allowing the determination of protein expression under different conditions in both
in vitro and in vivo studies.

In this project, I will be taking the tools and functions provided by the DEP package one 
after the other to have a feel of how to acquire the mass spectrometry data set, read into
R, process, normalize, visualize and compare protein expression across different groups.
